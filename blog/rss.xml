            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>4.6 billion is literally an astronomical figure. The richest star map of our galaxy, brought by Gaia space observatory, includes just under 2 billion stars. What does a view of 4.6 billion GitHub events really look like? What secrets and values can be discovered in such an enormous amount of data? </p><p>Here you go: <a href="https://ossinsight.io/">OSSInsight.io</a><strong> can help you find the answer</strong>. Itâs a useful insight tool that can give you the most updated open source intelligence, and help you deeply understand any single GitHub project or quickly compare any two projects by digging deep into 4.6 billion GitHub events in real time. Here are some ways you can play with it.</p><h2>Compare any two GitHub projects</h2><p>Do you wonder how different projects have performed and developed over time? Which project is worthy of more attention? <strong><a href="https://ossinsight.io/">OSSInsight.io</a></strong> can answer your questions via the <a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/pingcap/tidb">Compare Projects</a> page.</p><p>Letâs take the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes repository</a>  (K8s) and Dockerâs <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby">Moby repository</a> as examples and compare them in terms of popularity and coding vitality. </p><h3><strong>Popularity</strong></h3><p>To compare the popularity of two repositories, we use multiple metrics including the number of stars, the growth trend of stars over time, and stargazersâ geographic and employment distribution. </p><h4><strong>Number of stars</strong></h4><p>The line chart below shows the accumulated number of stars of K8s and Moby each year. According to the chart, Moby was ahead of K8s until late 2019. The star growth of Moby slowed after 2017 while K8s has kept a steady growth pace. </p><p><img src="./the-star-history.png"/></p><center><em>The star history of K8s and Moby</em></center><h4><strong>Geographical distribution of stargazers</strong></h4><p>The map below shows the stargazersâ geographical distribution of Moby and K8s. As you can see, their stargazers are scattered around the world with the majority coming from the US, Europe, and China.</p><p><img src="./geographicla-distribution-of-stargazers.png"/></p><center><em>The geographical distribution of K8s and Moby stargazers</em></center><h4><strong>Employment distribution of stargazers</strong></h4><p>The chart below shows the stargazersâ employment of K8s (red) and Moby (dark blue). Both of their stargazers work in a wide range of industries, and most come from leading dotcom companies such as Google, Tencent, and Microsoft. The difference is that the top two companies of K8sâ stargazers are  Google and Microsoft from the US, while Mobyâs top two followers are Tencent and Alibaba from China.  </p><p><img src="./employment-distribution-of-stargazers.png"/></p><center><em>The employment distribution of K8s and Moby stargazers</em></center><h3><strong>Coding vitality</strong></h3><p>To compare the coding vitality of two GitHub projects, we use many metrics including the growth trend of pull requests (PRs), the monthly number of PRs, commits and pushes, and the heat map of developersâ contribution time.  </p><h4><strong>Number of commits and pushes</strong></h4><p>The bar chart below shows the number of commits and pushes submitted to K8s (top) and Moby (bottom) each month after their inception. Generally speaking, K8s has more pushes and commits than Moby, and their number grew stably until 2020 followed by a slowdown afterwards. Mobyâs monthly pushes and commits had a minor growth between 2015 and 2017, and then barely increased after 2018.</p><p><img src="./monthly-pushes-and-commits.png"/></p><center><em>The monthly pushes and commits of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center><h4><strong>Number of PRs</strong></h4><p>The charts below show the monthly and accumulated number of PRs of the two repositories. As you can see, K8s has received stable and consistent PR contributions ever since its inception and its accumulated number of PRs has also grown steadily. Moby had vibrant PR submissions before late 2017, but started to drop afterwards. Its accumulated number of PRs reached a plateau in 2017, which has remained the case ever since. </p><p><img src="./monthly-and-accumulated-pr-number.png"/></p><center><em>The monthly and accumulated PR number of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center><h4><strong>Developersâ contribution time</strong></h4><p>The following heat map shows developersâ contribution time for K8s (left) and Moby (right). Each square represents one hour in a day. The darker the color, the more contributions occur during that time. K8s has many more dark parts than Moby, and K8sâ contributions occur almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. K8s definitely has more dynamic coding activities than Moby. </p><p><img src="./heat-map.png"/></p><center><em>Heat map of developersâ contribution time of K8s (left) and Moby (right)</em></center><br/><p><strong>Taken together</strong>, these metrics show that while both K8s and Moby are popular across industries world-wide, K8s has more vibrant coding activities than Moby. K8s is continuously gaining popularity and coding vitality while Moby is falling in both over time.</p><p>Popularity and coding vitality are just two dimensions to compare repositories. If you want to discover more insights or compare other projects you are interested in, feel free to visit the <a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/pingcap/tidb">Compare</a> page and explore it for yourself.  </p><p>Of course, you can use this same page to <strong>deeply explore any single GitHub project</strong> and gain the most up-to-date insights about them. The key metrics and the corresponding changes are presented in a panoramic view. More in-depth analytics such as code changes by PR size groups and PR lines are also available.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many times we hope that our data access becomes more real-time. It has diffrrent meanings for various industries. For logistics, it means that resource allocation can be carried out with a faster frequency. For e-commerce, it means quicker adjustment on promotion strategies based on sales information. It leads to faster risk management and more timely stop losses in finance as well.</p><p><img src="./scenerios.png"/></p><p>For developers, it means realtime insights on topics like the latest and hottest projects in the community, the organizations that contribute the most, the programming languages that are used the most, etc. In case of you want to know more personal information, such as what projects are your friends contributing recently, who contributed the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB</a>&#x27;s most recent PR, etc. Moreover, you want all these in real time.</p><p><img src="./top5-languages.png"/></p><p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.gharchive.org/">GH Archive</a> provides you the basic data to answer these questions. All you need is a database supporting these query. So simple!</p><p>In fact, you may find that it is not easy after you thinking about it carefully. You want the system provide the summary statistics with a large amount of data, such as the ranking of the most popular language in the figure above, as well as a large number of concurrent accesses to individual accounts. </p><p>You might need two systems: one of them focuses on high-concurrency detailed data services, while the other requires insight reports based on a large amount of data. Regardless of GitHub insights, you might encounter similar problems in your daily work. For example, if you are building a operational gaming data service system, you might face the customer inquery request: &quot;I just looted the sword of infinity, but I can&#x27;t find it in my backpack now!&quot; You need to quickly locate the loot data of that unlucky player from large volume of records to get a clue of the situation. Did he accidentally destroyed the sword? Is it ninjaed? Does the bored player simply want a chat with GMs? At the mean time, the operation team is also urging: &quot;For the recently launched class Night Lord, please give me the latest damage statistics immediately. I suspect that the Dark Hammer skill is too imba and need a nerf immediately.&quot;</p><p><strong>These all require your database to achieve all together:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Looking for a needle in a haystack</strong></li><li><strong>Quick analytical insights for massive data</strong></li><li><strong>Realtime updates</strong></li></ol><p>In the past, for massive detailed data services, you could choose NoSQL or data sharding. NoSQL is a popular choice for massive hot data storage, but its disadvantages are also quite obvious: you cannot use SQL to express complex semantics, and it also lacks a proper indexing mechanism to locate data through dimensions other than the primary key.  At the meantime, data sharding is quite cumbersome. Scaling the cluster as well as desining the partition key takes you a lot of effort. Moreover, for analytical services , you might need to deploy a dedicated analytical database, and take care of the real-time ETL pipeline. For a small number of mission critical applications, you just grit your teeth and do it. But for the increasingly complex needs of analytics and data services, you need to consider whether it is worthy or not.</p><p>In the selection, you want a solution with the SQL capabilities of traditional databases, mature indexing mechanism, real-time reporting ability and scalability. Additionally, it&#x27;s better to have a simple solution, requiring no esoteric knowledge of engineering.</p><p>Yes, <a href="https://en.pingcap.com/?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB</a> has them all.</p><p>:::note
ð¡ You can read <strong><a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB Documentation</a></strong> to get more useful infomation.
:::</p><p>As an HTAP database, TiDB has both complete transactions support and high performance analytics at ease. When users want to locate detailed data (such as querying the latest commit records via github ID or affiliated organization), you can build fine-grained indexes for multiple dimensions for fast locating and high concurrency. At the same time,  TiDB&#x27;s analytics engine, <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tiflash-overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiFlash</a> , has built-in support for high-frequency updates. A column storage system (yes, even transactional updates of hundreds of thousands of TPS) that allows data to be seamlessly synchronized in real-time for analysis. Users only need to submit SQL queries without caring about the types of query, and the optimizer will automatically choose the optimal way to evaluate. In fact, it may not be possible for you to precisely distinguish which engine is more suitable. Consider quering for an individual organization: if it is a small organization with three or five people, the GitHub events since its creation may not exceed 10,000. While for giants like Microsoft and Alibaba, the difference on data volume is in orders of magnitude. In such case, the choice of engines becomes quite subtle, let alone separate the workloads in different databases. For TiDB, the choice is automatic: through statistical estimation, TiDB can &quot;guess&quot; the amount of data accessed and combine it with a cost model to find the most appropriate way to execute. In addition, TiDB is MySQL compatible with sufficient talent pool. This helps you shorten the development cycle greatly.</p><p>In fact, in addition to interesting projects like OSS Insight, TiDB has a wide range of applications in similar real-time data insights and services, such as history order serving , advertising , risk management, datahub, logistics tracking and etc.</p><p>Unleashing the value of real-time data has become more and more important, and hope <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB</a> can lend you a helping hand.</p><p>:::info</p><h3>ð Details in how OSS Insight works</h3><p>Go to read <a href="/blog/try-it-yourself">Use TiDB Cloud to Analyze GitHub Events in 10 Minutes</a> and use the <a href="https://tidbcloud.com/signup?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">Developer Tier</a> <strong>free</strong> for 1 year.</p><p>You can find how we deal with massive github data in <a href="/blog/how-it-works">Data Preparation for Analytics</a> as well!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Providing insights on large volume of email data might not be as easy as we thought. While data coming in real-time, indices and metadata are to be built consistently. To make things worse, the data volume is beyond traditional single node databases&#x27; reach.</p></blockquote><h2>Background</h2><p>To store large volumes of real-time user data like email and provide insights is not easy. If your application is layered on top of Gmail to automatically extract and organize the useful information buried inside of our inboxes.</p><p> It became clear that they were going to need a better system for organizing terabytes of email metadata to power collaboration as their customer base rapidly increased, it is not easy to provide insights. You need to organize email data by first applying a unique identifier to the emails and then proactively indexing the email metadata. The unique identifier is what connects the same email headers across. For each email inserted in real-time, the system extracts meta information from it and builds indices for high concurrent access. When data volume is small, it&#x27;s all good: traditional databases provide all you need. However, when data size grows beyond a single node&#x27;s capacity, everything becomes very hard.</p><h2>Potential Database Solutions</h2><p>Regarding databases, there are some options you might consider:</p><ol><li><strong>NoSQL database.</strong> While fairly scalable, it does not provide you indexing and comprehensive query abilities. You might end up implementing them in your application code.</li><li><strong>Sharing cluster of databases.</strong> Designing sharding key and paying attention to the limitations between shards are painful. It might be fine for applications with simple schema designs, but it will be too complicated for CRM. Moreover, it&#x27;s very hard to maintain.</li><li><strong>Analytical databases.</strong> They are fine for dashboard and reporting. But not fine for high concurrent updates and index based serving.</li></ol><h2>How to get real-time insights</h2><p><a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB</a> is a distributed database with user experience of traditional databases. It looks like a super large MySQL without the limitations of NoSQL and sharding cluster solutions. With TiDB, you can simply have the base information, indices and metadata being updated in a concurrent manner with the help of cross-node transaction ability. </p><p>To build such a system, you just need following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Create schemas</strong> according to your access pattern with indices on user name, organization, job title etc.</li><li><strong>Use streaming system</strong> to gather and extract meta information from your base data</li><li><strong>Insert into TiDB via ordinary MySQL client driver like JDBC.</strong> You might want to gather data in small batches of hundreds of rows to speed up ingestion. In a single transaction, updates on base data, indices and meta information are guaranteed to be consistent.</li><li>Optionally, <strong>deploy a couple of <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tiflash-overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiFlash</a> nodes</strong> to speed up large scale reporting queries.</li><li><strong>Access the data</strong> just like in MySQL and you are all done. SQL features for analytics like aggregations, multi-joins or window functions are all supported with great performance.</li></ol><p>For more cases, please see <a href="https://en.pingcap.com/customers/?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">here</a>.</p><p>:::info</p><h3>ð Details in how OSS Insight works</h3><p>Go to read <a href="/blog/try-it-yourself">Use TiDB Cloud to Analyze GitHub Events in 10 Minutes</a> and use the <a href="https://tidbcloud.com/signup?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">Developer Tier</a> <strong>free</strong> for 1 year.</p><p>You can find how we deal with massive github data in <a href="/blog/how-it-works">Data Preparation for Analytics</a> as well!
